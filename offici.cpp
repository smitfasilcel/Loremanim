// The GraphicsContext instance. Any filters, blend mode settings, clip 
// regions, and transformations applied to the GraphicsContext will affect 
// subsequent rendering operations. This includes drawing shapes, images, 
// text, and other graphical elements.
//
// The GraphicsContext allows for advanced graphics manipulation by providing 
// capabilities such as:
//
// - **Filters**: Apply visual effects to the rendered content, such as blurring, 
//   sharpening, or color adjustments.
// - **Blend Modes**: Control how colors from different layers are combined. 
//   Common blend modes include multiply, screen, and overlay.
// - **Clipping**: Restrict rendering to specific areas of the canvas. This is 
//   useful for creating complex shapes and maintaining efficient rendering 
//   pipelines.
// - **Transformations**: Modify the coordinate system through scaling, rotation, 
//   translation, and skewing, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive 
//   graphics.
